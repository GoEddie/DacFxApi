DacFx Api Examples


I found the learning curve to understand the DacFx api pretty high so this is a collection of samples to make it easier to understand.

To run any of the samples that use the script dom then you will need the Sql Server feature pack:

SqlDom.msi

from:

"Microsoft® SQL Server® 2014 Feature Pack"


If you are using the DacFx api to write something cool, please share it with the community! 

If you need any help then give me a shout, goeddieuk @ gmail . com

Enjoy!
